							<h1 class="major">My Background</h1>
							<p>I am a born and raised Australian with an English and Croatian background. 
								Throughout my teen years I was heavily involved in swimming and was at my peak competing at a national level. Unfortunately, due to a constant battle with glandular fever (because of the unhygienic nature of the pool I trained in), I decided to stop competing and swimming altogether.
								My previous education consists of, completing school until year eleven, then moving onto studying certificate three in commercial cookery at my local TAFE institute.</p>
								<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
								<p>My interest in IT is based on wanting to find out why things are the way they are. I find it interesting to be able to learn about programs, games, websites, or systems. If its installing new parts, looking at code, or even certain mechanics and animations within games, I want to know how it all comes together to reach a result.
								When I was a kid my dad brought home our first family computer, he explained that sending an email to another country would take as long as it took to dial the phone. For some reason unbeknown to me I was not allowed to spend too much time on the computer due to my mother just outright saying NO. 
								This made using computers or gaming consoles somewhat taboo throughout my childhood until I was old enough to get a job and buy a computer and gaming consoles. 
								I have been exploring the abilities of IT systems ever since, mostly by watching Youtube videos of other people using their IT knowledge for a humorous outcome,  such as people playing video games or using robotics and computer components to create outrageous or even useless inventions, if it had a funny side to it I found it easier to understand and follow than just a regular tutorial.
								I have never really delved into any sort of system or program with fears of doing something wrong (I once tried to install a new SSD into my PC and got blue screened). Therefore, I have decided to improve my knowledge by taking on a bachelor of IT and making IT a bigger part of my life by working with it and learning about it every day.</p>
							<p>RMIT popped up as an Instagram ad for me as I was scrolling through one day so I decided to look into it more through Open Universities Australia. As I was going through researching the courses that RMIT provides I came across the Bachelor of IT. After looking through the course criteria I noticed that I could do two of the core subjects to be able to study the bachelor, this got my interest and I decided within a week to sign up for the next semester. I expect to have gained a better understanding and acquire some new knowledge of IT by the end of this course. I expect to implement this knowledge towards what I want to study full-time and the job I wish to have in the near future. </p>
