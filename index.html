							<h2>Project Idea</h2>
							<h3> A Voting Application</h3>
							<p>Voting is an age-old process, wait in line, check off your details, fill out the ballot and put it in a box. This process can take a matter of hours if the voting area is busy. 
								If you’re are unable to vote from the area that you live in you have to do a postal vote, this is an even more tedious and annoying process.
								The ability to do everything from our phone is slowly becoming a reality, I believe that having an app that streamlines the process and allows us to cast our vote from anywhere in the world would bring voting into this new age of everything being done “on the go”. 
								</p>
								<section>
									<h3>Reasoning</h3>
									<p>Not only is voting compulsory but it allows you as a citizen to participate in the democratic process and have a voice.
										There are multiple ways to vote; overseas voting centres, mobile voting teams for remote areas and aged care facilities and polling places. These use a lot of paper-based products like ballot papers, the boxes the ballots go into and even the temporary stalls used to vote. This would have a clear impact on the environment given of paper that goes into voting.
										All of this could be eliminated if the correct time and resources were put into developing an app that includes all of the different ways we can vote.
										According to the Australian Electoral Commission, ‘hundreds of thousands of votes could not be counted because people did not follow the instructions on the ballot paper correctly’(Australian Electoral Commission 2019). This is another example as to why voting could be made easier via the use of an app. People, especially younger generations, are becoming more fluent with touch screen devices, apps and educational programs and may find it easier to take instructions from an app with semi-interactive features such as animations or videos detailing exactly how to vote correctly. 
										</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<h3>Features</h3>
									<li>This app will need to be provided for free. By the government if possible so it is seen as a legitimate enterprise.</li>
									<li>The app will need to have clear and concise instructions on how to use the app to vote and how to vote properly. These instructions are available via text, visual tutorials like a practice vote simulation with step by step instructions, or an instructional video with clear narrations throughout.</li>
									<li>It will have a user friendly easy to use interface that can also be translated into your first language if English is not as familiar to you.</li>
									<li>Setting up your account to vote can be as easy as linking your MYGOV account, you will then check all information is correct and up to date. You will need to assign a pin to the app, for added security but also ease of access when logging back in.</li>
									<li>If you are overseas or not within your voting district the app can use your phone's GPS to pinpoint your location so that you can still take part in the voting process. this feature will also be used to help you navigate to your polling place.</li>
									<li>There will be an information section to the app that will allow you to research the parties you are voting for. This section will be completely optional it’s just information there if you need it. You may find using this as a way to form an opinion on who you may want to vote for.</li>
									<li>This app will send alerts or reminders about an upcoming election or remind you that you still need to take the time to vote, it will also alert you if there are any changes to your district or divisional boundaries and allow you to have an input on the distribution process by submitting your query right from your phone.</li>
									<li>Once you have started voting you will need to check all ballot boxes to move forward. The app won't move if there is information missing or if you just input 1,2,3,4,5 as your vote. This will ensure that every vote is taken seriously.
										When you have completed the voting process you will be emailed a receipt stating that your vote has been submitted.</li>
							<p></p>

									<h3>Implementation</h3>
									<p>Many companies give you the ability to create an app with no coding necessary. 
										Companies like <a href="https://www.appypie.com/">appypie.com</a> have designed self-coding software to make it easier for everyone to create an app. This program is a basic click and drag default layouts and use ready-made inputs designer. This program may be a bit too easy for this kind of project. I believe that hiring or subcontracting to a development company would be the best way to get this app up and running. This will come at a high price but it will be necessary for the correct implementation of this app given it will hold sensitive information. After some research, I arrived at <a href="https://ebpearls.com.au"> ebpearls.com.au</a> to work on this app given they have experience with large companies and government enterprises such as the New South Wales government, University of New South Wales, and the University of Sydney.
										
										If is was to take on this app myself knowing how to use programming languages like Python or Javascript would be useful to implement within the app. I have not had any personal experience with these programs but am willing to learn. From my quick research they seem to be easy to pick up yet very complex. I am able to take certain paid online courses to learn these programs, but I am also aware that I could use a lot of Youtube videos and other resources to learn for free.
									</p>
										<h5>Drawback and Solution</h5>
										<p>The main obstacle that I foresee will be privacy. People are always wary of providing personal information over a phone, internet, and even E-mails, this hesitance could prove difficult in getting the majority of the Australian population of ages 18 and above to download an application that needs a lot personal details to work correctly.
											In saying this, people are comfortable providing similar personal information to do some online shopping or sign up for something like Facebook. It will take a matter of convincing the general public that they are safe when using this product by implementing the correct anti-theft or firewall procedures to ensure that the public knows they are safe from things like identity theft.
											</p>

									<h3>Outcomes</h3>
									<p>With this app I not only do I want to cut back the environmental impact that voting has but make it an easier, more interactive and fun process. We are getting further from the pen to paper days every year, I believe that streamlining this process and bringing it into the modern world will make it easier and less of a hassle than it seems to be. If we can get something like this app off the ground in Australia it could lead the way for other countries to follow suit. It could also open many other doors for other companies to adopt a similar app for allowing their employees or customers to vote on a product or have an input.</p>
